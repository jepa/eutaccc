# Results 

All results here are now an average of all 5 Earth System Models giving more robustness to results. We can also show the uncertainty in the projections as standard deviation or as direction-agreement between models. 

# Proportion change per division

These maps represent the change in the projected MCP proportion by division in the mid 21st century (average of 2020-2040; AA_med) and the late 21st century (2080-2100; AA_end) relative to the reference years (average of 1973-1978).. That is, if division a division had 20% of the stock in 1973 and has 10% in 2020, then it is a 50% reduction of MCP proportion.  


- *division_change_map_26.jpg*, this map represents the changes at mid and end of the century for RCP 2.6 low emission scenario (ssp 126)

- *division_change_map_85.jpg*, this map represents the changes at mid and end of the century for RCP 8.5 high emission scenario (ssp 585)


# Division proportion line-plots

These plots show the projected MCP proportion that each division has from a stock between 1951 to 2100. The vertical black line represents the historical period when the quota was established. 

- *division_proportion_area.jpg*, this figure shows the proportion as an area plot adding to 100% in all cases. It includes but rcp 2.6 and 8.5 in the facets 

- *division_proportion_line.jpg*, this one shows the same thing but as a single line (not area). Dashed and solid lines represents the different RCPs.

# Time change

These maps are showing the (percentage) change in Maximum Catch Potential (MCP) *per* division and stock by the mid 21st century (average of 2020-2040; AA_med) and the late 21st century (2080-2100; AA_end) relative to the reference years (average of 1973-1978).

So, basically how much is the MCP of each stock projected to change (increased or decreased) relative to the quota-reference years.

- *time_change_85.jpg*, this map represents the changes at mid and end of the century for RCP 8.5 high emission scenario (ssp 585)
